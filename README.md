# Onapsis Challenge

Iterate throw an integer array and return the add of all its elements.
After that, make another function to add every double of every element.
Completed that, make another function to add every square of every element. 

To prevent the if/else statements, try to do this in a functional way.

## To reproduce 

1. Create a `virutalenv` called `env` 
1. Activate the environment with `source env/bin/activate`
1. Install `pip` dependencies executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Execute Python test executing `pytest`

You should see something like:
